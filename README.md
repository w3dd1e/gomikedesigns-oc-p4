Project #4 Web Development - OpenClassrooms

In this scenario, your friend Mike has a freelance web design website, but you offer to optimize the website's SEO and accessibility. 

I reiewed the HTML, CSS, and Javascript for issues and created Google Lighthouse reports for the desktop and mobile versions of this site. I made a list of issues I found, explaining each and good practices to adopt before correcting each one.
